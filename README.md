# FIFA-2021-ML
Comparison of different ML models on FIFA-2021 Players data <br>
*Datasets are collected from Kaggle.* <br>
Brief description of almost almost all codes are provided. I will keep adding explanations. <br>
A number of ML algorithms are not yet completed (including the likes of Bootstrap Aggregation and XGBoost), I will update them gradually. <br>
It also has an optimization program that chooses the best team based on certain constraints that can be modified by the User.<br>
I am still in the process of developing it and some functionalities are not fully developed yet. <br>
Also, I am working on cleaning up the code so that some unnecessary data files can be removed. <br>
Aesthetics of the app are yet to be finalized, will kepp updating as I move along with the project. <br>
I will upload the whole how-to-use thing soon, for now `shiny::runApp()` should work on the front end. <br>
Any feedback/contribution is welcome.
