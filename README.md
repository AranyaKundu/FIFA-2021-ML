# FIFA-2021-ML
Comparison of different ML models on FIFA-2021 Players data <br>
This is a big project with a lot of ML algorithms (including the likes of Bootstrap Aggregation and XGBoost), so running the app will take more time than you would expect. <br>
I am still in the process of developing it and some functionalities are not fully developed yet. <br>
Aesthetics of the app are yet to be finalized, will kepp updating as I move along with the project. <br>
I will upload the whole how-to-use thing soon, for now `shiny::runApp()` should work on the front end.
